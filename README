This is a small program for the Harvest interview process to find the saddle point of a matrix

Run the program by providing a list of files from the command line that contain 5x5 matrix arrays for testing. ie.

ruby saddle_points.rb input.txt

The program will output all coordinates of found saddle points and "No saddle points found" in the case that the matrix does not contain any.

For clarity, a row of equal signs (=) will be printed to mark a new matrix
